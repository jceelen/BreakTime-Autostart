#BreakTime-Autostart

BreakTime-Autostart makes sure that breaktime will start, by default the application opens but is not started. 
You need Lingon to start the script. 

If it runs the script checks if BreakTime is enabled or not. If BreakTime is not enabled, it will be enabled by the script. If you want to have this script run automatically on a regular interval, use the program Lingon.

REQUIREMENTS:
* BreakTime (http://breaktimeapp.com)
* [Lingon X or Lingon 3](http://www.peterborgapps.com/lingon)

Have fun with the script.
